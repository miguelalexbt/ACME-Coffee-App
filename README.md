# ACME Coffee Shop

ACME is a coffee shop that intends to implement a more efficient ordering system, supplying an Android app to its customers and employees.

The client and the terminal applications were built using [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) and the [Android Jetpack](https://developer.android.com/jetpack) libraries.
The backend was built using [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/), [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) and [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).
